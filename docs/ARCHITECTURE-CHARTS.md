# codestra-backend — Architecture Charts

> Repository: `appolon1908/codestra-backend`  
> Baseline branch: `main`  
> Purpose: repository-local visual architecture. These charts describe the intended ownership boundary and should be updated with code changes.

## 1. System context

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Frontend / trusted clients"] --> B["Django API"]
  B --> C["codestra-backend<br/>Codestra application backend"]
  C --> D["PostgreSQL / Redis"]
  C --> E["Middleware and app consumers"]
```

## 2. Internal component architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  IN["Entrypoint / API / CLI"] --> AUTH["Authentication, policy and validation"]
  AUTH --> DOMAIN["Core domain / orchestration"]
  DOMAIN --> STATE["Persistence / configuration / state"]
  DOMAIN --> ADAPTER["Adapters and integrations"]
  ADAPTER --> DEPS["Approved external dependencies"]
  DOMAIN --> OBS["Metrics, logs, traces and audit"]
```

## 3. Critical runtime flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Caller
  participant Boundary as codestra-backend
  participant Policy as Auth/Policy
  participant Core as Domain/Core
  participant State as State/Store
  participant Dep as Dependency
  Caller->>Boundary: Request / event / command
  Boundary->>Policy: Validate identity + input
  Policy-->>Boundary: Allowed / denied
  Boundary->>Core: Execute Authenticated request, domain write and async processing flow
  Core->>State: Persist or read state
  Core->>Dep: Bounded integration call
  Dep-->>Core: Result / readback
  Core-->>Caller: Normalized response
```

## 4. Deployment and promotion

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  DEV["Feature branch"] --> TEST["Unit / contract / static tests"]
  TEST --> PR["Pull request + review"]
  PR --> CI["Required CI green"]
  CI --> STAGE["Staging / isolated verification"]
  STAGE --> CERT["Exact-SHA certification"]
  CERT --> APPROVAL{"Production approval?"}
  APPROVAL -- "No" --> STAGE
  APPROVAL -- "Yes" --> PROD["Production promotion"]
  PROD --> VERIFY["Health, readiness, metrics and rollback check"]
```

## 5. Observability and recovery

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R["codestra-backend runtime"] --> M["Metrics"]
  R --> L["Logs / audit"]
  R --> T["Traces / correlation"]
  M --> O["Observability stack"]
  L --> O
  T --> O
  O --> A["Alerts / dashboards"]
  R --> B["Backup / configuration snapshot"]
  B --> REC["Restore / rollback rehearsal"]
```

## Architecture ownership

- **Repository role:** Codestra application backend
- **Primary boundary:** Django API
- **State/configuration:** PostgreSQL / Redis
- **Downstream/consumers:** Middleware and app consumers
- Cross-repository effects must use approved contracts; do not create hidden direct-write paths.
- Production effects remain separately gated and are not authorized by this document.
